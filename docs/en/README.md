## 🚀 Quick Overview

This Terraform infrastructure provides:

### ✨ Key Features
- **Environment Safety**: Automatic filtering prevents accidental production deployments
- **Lifecycle Management**: Progressive feature promotion through environments
- **Production Ready**: Battle-tested patterns and security best practices
- **Flexible Configuration**: Support for complex targeting and A/B testing
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive input validation and error checking

### 🏗️ Architecture Components

| Component | Purpose | Location |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| **Core Module** | Reusable Terraform module for Split.io integration | `modules/split-feature-flags/` |
| **Use Cases** | Real-world implementation examples | `use-cases/` |
| **Examples** | Simple, copy-paste ready configurations | `examples/` |

- Payment gateway switching
- UI/UX experiments
- Inventory management
- Customer segmentation

### Mobile Applications (Coming Soon)
Mobile-specific feature management for:
- App store rollouts
- Device-specific features
- Performance optimizations
- User experience testing

## 📊 Environment Management Strategy

Our environment management follows a progressive promotion model:

```
Development → Staging → Production
```

### Environment Safety Features

1. **Automatic Filtering**: Features marked for specific environments only deploy to those environments
2. **Lifecycle Tracking**: Clear progression from development to production
3. **Safety Validation**: Prevents experimental features from reaching production accidentally

### Example Environment Configuration

```hcl
# Development-only feature
{
  name = "experimental-ui"
  environments = ["dev"]
  lifecycle_stage = "development"
  category = "experiment"
}

# Production-ready feature
{
  name = "payment-processing"
  environments = ["dev", "staging", "prod"]
  lifecycle_stage = "production"
  category = "feature"
}
```

## 🔧 Quick Start Guide

### 1. Prerequisites
- Terraform >= 1.5
- Split.io account and API key
- Access to Split.io workspace

### 2. Choose Your Implementation

#### Option A: Use Existing Use Case
```bash
cd use-cases/banking-platform
# Configure your API key
terraform apply -var-file="environments/dev.tfvars" -var="split_api_key=your-key"
```

#### Option B: Use Module Directly
```hcl
module "feature_flags" {
  source = "./modules/split-feature-flags"
  
  workspace_name    = "MyWorkspace"
  environment_name  = "dev"
  is_production    = false
  traffic_type_name = "user"
  feature_flags     = var.feature_flags
}
```

### 3. Deployment Commands

```bash
# Development Environment
terraform apply \
  -var-file="environments/dev.tfvars" \
  -var="split_api_key=your-dev-key"

# Staging Environment
terraform apply \
  -var-file="environments/staging.tfvars" \
  -var="split_api_key=your-staging-key"

# Production Environment
terraform apply \
  -var-file="environments/prod.tfvars" \
  -var="split_api_key=your-prod-key"
```

## 📈 Feature Flag Lifecycle

### 1. Development Phase
- Create feature flag with `environments = ["dev"]`
- Test functionality in development environment
- Validate feature behavior and performance

### 2. Testing Phase
- Update to `environments = ["dev", "staging"]`
- Run QA testing and validation
- Performance and security testing

### 3. Production Phase
- Update to `environments = ["dev", "staging", "prod"]`
- Gradual rollout with percentage-based targeting
- Monitor metrics and user feedback

### 4. Maintenance Phase
- Mark as `lifecycle_stage = "deprecated"`
- Plan removal timeline
- Clean up code dependencies

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### API Key Management
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables or secret management systems
- Rotate keys regularly
- Use different keys per environment

### Environment Isolation
- Separate Terraform state files per environment
- Use workspace-specific configurations
- Implement proper access controls

### Validation and Testing
- Always validate configurations before applying
- Test in development before promoting
- Use gradual rollouts for production features

## 📚 Advanced Topics

### Custom Targeting Rules
Learn how to implement complex targeting strategies:
- User segment-based targeting
- Geographic targeting
- Device and platform targeting
- Percentage-based rollouts

### A/B Testing Setup
Configure sophisticated A/B testing scenarios:
- Multi-variant testing
- Statistical significance tracking
- Conversion rate optimization
- Custom metrics tracking

### Integration Patterns
Integrate with existing infrastructure:
- CI/CD pipeline integration
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Automated rollback strategies
- Performance impact monitoring
