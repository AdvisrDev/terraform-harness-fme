# Best Practices for Feature Flag Management

This guide provides production-ready best practices for implementing and managing feature flags using our Terraform module.

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Best Practices

### 1. Environment Strategy

#### Progressive Environment Deployment
```
Development ‚Üí Staging ‚Üí Production
     ‚Üì           ‚Üì         ‚Üì
   Experiment   Test     Deploy
```

**Key Principles:**
- Start all new features in development environment only
- Use staging for production-like validation
- Deploy to production with conservative rollout percentages
- Never skip environment progression for critical features

#### Environment-Specific Configuration Pattern
```hcl
{
  name = "api-optimization"
  environments = ["dev", "staging", "prod"]
  
  environment_configs = {
    dev = {
      # Relaxed settings for development
      treatments = [{
        configurations = "{\"timeout\": 60, \"debug\": true}"
      }]
    }
    
    staging = {
      # Production-like with monitoring
      treatments = [{
        configurations = "{\"timeout\": 30, \"monitoring\": true}"
      }]
    }
    
    prod = {
      # Optimized for production
      treatments = [{
        configurations = "{\"timeout\": 20, \"strict_validation\": true}"
      }]
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. Naming Conventions

#### Feature Flag Naming
- **Use kebab-case**: `payment-processor-v2`
- **Include version numbers**: `checkout-flow-v3`
- **Be descriptive**: `advanced-fraud-detection` not `fraud`
- **Include context**: `mobile-app-dark-mode` not `dark-mode`

#### Treatment Naming
- **Be explicit**: `enhanced`, `disabled`, `legacy`
- **Avoid ambiguous terms**: Use `off`/`on` or `disabled`/`enabled`
- **Include context when needed**: `basic_tier`, `premium_tier`

#### Environment Naming
- **Standard names**: `dev`, `staging`, `prod`
- **Consistent across team**: Establish team standards
- **Descriptive for special cases**: `perf-test`, `security-test`

### 3. Safety Measures

#### Default Treatment Strategy
```hcl
# ‚úÖ Good: Safe default
{
  name = "new-payment-flow"
  default_treatment = "legacy_flow"  # Existing behavior
}

# ‚ùå Bad: Risky default
{
  name = "experimental-feature"
  default_treatment = "experimental"  # Untested behavior
}
```

#### Progressive Rollout Pattern
```hcl
# Week 1: 5% rollout
rules = [
  {
    treatment = "new_feature"
    size      = 5
  }
]

# Week 2: 25% rollout (after monitoring)
rules = [
  {
    treatment = "new_feature"
    size      = 25
  }
]

# Week 3: 100% rollout (after validation)
rules = [
  {
    treatment = "new_feature"
    size      = 100
  }
]
```

## üîÑ Lifecycle Management

### 1. Feature Flag Lifecycle Stages

#### Development Stage
- **Purpose**: Initial development and testing
- **Environment**: `dev` only
- **Characteristics**: High volatility, experimental features
- **Duration**: 1-2 weeks

```hcl
{
  lifecycle_stage = "development"
  environments    = ["dev"]
  category        = "feature"
}
```

#### Testing Stage
- **Purpose**: QA validation and integration testing
- **Environment**: `dev`, `staging`
- **Characteristics**: Stable API, comprehensive testing
- **Duration**: 2-4 weeks

```hcl
{
  lifecycle_stage = "testing"
  environments    = ["dev", "staging"]
  category        = "experiment"
}
```

#### Production Stage
- **Purpose**: Live feature serving real users
- **Environment**: All environments
- **Characteristics**: Stable, monitored, optimized
- **Duration**: Ongoing

```hcl
{
  lifecycle_stage = "production"
  environments    = ["dev", "staging", "prod"]
  category        = "feature"
}
```

#### Deprecated Stage
- **Purpose**: Feature being phased out
- **Environment**: Variable (usually prod only for migration)
- **Characteristics**: Sunset planning, migration support
- **Duration**: Defined sunset timeline

```hcl
{
  lifecycle_stage = "deprecated"
  environments    = ["prod"]  # For migration support only
  category        = "feature"
}
```

### 2. Lifecycle Transition Criteria

## üéØ Targeting and Segmentation

### 1. Targeting Strategies

#### User Segment Targeting
```hcl
rules = [
  {
    treatment = "premium_features"
    size      = 100
    condition = {
      matcher = {
        type      = "IN_SEGMENT"
        attribute = "subscription_tier"
        strings   = ["premium", "enterprise"]
      }
    }
  }
]
```

#### Geographic Targeting
```hcl
rules = [
  {
    treatment = "eu_compliance_features"
    size      = 100
    condition = {
      matcher = {
        type      = "IN_SEGMENT"
        attribute = "user_region"
        strings   = ["EU", "EEA"]
      }
    }
  }
]
```

#### Percentage-Based Rollouts
```hcl
# Gradual rollout pattern
rules = [
  {
    treatment = "new_feature"
    size      = 10  # 10% of users
  }
]
```

### 2. Segmentation Best Practices

#### Clear Segment Definitions
- Define segments based on business criteria
- Use meaningful attribute names
- Document segment membership criteria
- Maintain segment data quality

#### Mutually Exclusive Segments
- Ensure user can only be in one segment per feature
- Avoid overlapping conditions
- Use clear hierarchy when multiple conditions exist

## üõ°Ô∏è Security and Compliance

### 1. Security Best Practices

#### API Key Management
```bash
# ‚úÖ Good: Environment variable
export TF_VAR_split_api_key="your-api-key"

# ‚ùå Bad: Hardcoded in files
split_api_key = "your-api-key"  # Never do this!
```

#### Configuration Validation
```hcl
variable "feature_flags" {
  validation {
    condition = alltrue([
      for ff in var.feature_flags :
      ff.category != "killswitch" || ff.default_treatment == "off"
    ])
    error_message = "Killswitch flags must default to 'off' for safety"
  }
}
```

### 2. Compliance Considerations

#### Audit Trail Requirements
- Log all feature flag changes with user attribution
- Maintain approval workflow evidence
- Track environment promotion history
- Record business impact measurements

#### Data Privacy
- Avoid storing PII in feature flag configurations
- Use hashed or anonymized identifiers
- Implement data retention policies
- Consider GDPR/CCPA requirements for user targeting

## üìä Monitoring and Observability

## üöÄ Deployment Strategies

### 1. Deployment Patterns

#### Blue-Green with Feature Flags
```hcl
{
  name = "deployment-router"
  treatments = [
    {
      name = "blue"
      configurations = "{\"version\": \"current\", \"endpoint\": \"blue\"}"
    },
    {
      name = "green" 
      configurations = "{\"version\": \"new\", \"endpoint\": \"green\"}"
    }
  ]
  rules = [
    {
      treatment = "green"
      size      = 0  # Start with 0%, gradually increase
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Canary Releases
```hcl
{
  name = "canary-deployment"
  rules = [
    {
      treatment = "canary"
      size      = 5  # 5% canary traffic
      condition = {
        matcher = {
          type      = "IN_SEGMENT"
          attribute = "user_tier"
          strings   = ["internal", "beta"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Rollback Strategies

#### Immediate Rollback (Killswitch)
```hcl
{
  name = "emergency-rollback"
  category = "killswitch"
  default_treatment = "safe_mode"
  rules = []  # Manual control only
}
```

#### Gradual Rollback
```hcl
# Reduce percentage over time
# Week 1: 50% ‚Üí 25%
# Week 2: 25% ‚Üí 10%  
# Week 3: 10% ‚Üí 0%
```

## üîß Terraform Workflows

### 1. Feature Flag Lifecycle Management

#### Environment Progression Pattern
```bash
# Development: Create new feature flag
terraform apply -var-file="environments/dev.tfvars" \
  -var="split_api_key=$TF_VAR_split_api_key"

# Testing: Add staging environment to feature flag
# Update feature flag configuration: environments = ["dev", "staging"]
terraform apply -var-file="environments/staging.tfvars" \
  -var="split_api_key=$TF_VAR_split_api_key"

# Production: Add production environment to feature flag
# Update feature flag configuration: environments = ["dev", "staging", "prod"]
terraform apply -var-file="environments/prod.tfvars" \
  -var="split_api_key=$TF_VAR_split_api_key"
```

#### Configuration Review Checklist
- [ ] Feature flag name follows naming conventions
- [ ] Default treatment is safe
- [ ] Environment progression is appropriate
- [ ] Targeting rules are validated
- [ ] Documentation is updated

### 2. Local Terraform Validation

#### Configuration Validation
```bash
# Validate Terraform syntax
terraform validate

# Format Terraform files
terraform fmt -recursive

# Plan changes before applying
terraform plan -var-file="environments/dev.tfvars" \
  -var="split_api_key=$TF_VAR_split_api_key"
```

#### Environment-Specific Deployments
```bash
# Development deployment
terraform workspace select dev
terraform apply -var-file="environments/dev.tfvars"

# Staging deployment  
terraform workspace select staging
terraform apply -var-file="environments/staging.tfvars"

# Production deployment
terraform workspace select prod
terraform apply -var-file="environments/prod.tfvars"
```

## üß™ Terraform Configuration Testing

### 1. Module Configuration Testing

#### Terraform Plan Testing
```bash
# Test development configuration
terraform plan -var-file="environments/dev.tfvars" \
  -var="split_api_key=$TF_VAR_split_api_key" \
  -out=dev.tfplan

# Test staging configuration  
terraform plan -var-file="environments/staging.tfvars" \
  -var="split_api_key=$TF_VAR_split_api_key" \
  -out=staging.tfplan

# Test production configuration
terraform plan -var-file="environments/prod.tfvars" \
  -var="split_api_key=$TF_VAR_split_api_key" \
  -out=prod.tfplan
```

#### Configuration Validation Testing
```bash
# Validate all environment configurations
for env in dev staging prod; do
  echo "Testing $env environment..."
  terraform validate
  terraform plan -var-file="environments/${env}.tfvars" \
    -var="split_api_key=dummy-key-for-validation" \
    -refresh=false
done
```

### 2. Feature Flag Configuration Best Practices

#### A/B Testing Configuration
- Define clear success criteria in feature flag descriptions
- Use meaningful treatment names 
- Configure appropriate percentage splits
- Document expected outcomes

#### A/B Test Configuration Pattern
```hcl
{
  name = "checkout-optimization-test"
  description = "A/B test comparing original vs optimized checkout flow"
  category = "experiment"
  default_treatment = "control"
  
  treatments = [
    {
      name = "control"
      configurations = "{\"variant\": \"original\", \"flow_type\": \"standard\"}"
      description = "Original checkout flow"
    },
    {
      name = "treatment"
      configurations = "{\"variant\": \"optimized\", \"flow_type\": \"streamlined\"}"
      description = "Optimized checkout flow"
    }
  ]
  
  rules = [
    {
      treatment = "treatment"
      size      = 50  # 50/50 split for A/B test
    }
  ]
}
```
