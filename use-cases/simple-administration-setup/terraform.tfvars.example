# Example terraform.tfvars file for simple administration setup
# Copy this file to terraform.tfvars and customize for your needs

# Split.io configuration
# Note: Set your Split.io API token as an environment variable:
# export SPLIT_API_TOKEN="your-api-token-here"

# These values are used in the main.tf configuration
# You can override them here if needed

# Example: Override workspace name
# workspace_name = "my-company-features"

# Example: Add additional workspace tags
# additional_workspace_tags = {
#   Department = "Engineering"
#   CostCenter = "ENG-001"
#   Project    = "FeatureManagement"
# }
